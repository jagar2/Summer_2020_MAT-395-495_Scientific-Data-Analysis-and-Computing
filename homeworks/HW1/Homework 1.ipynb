Note that this is a realistic data file in that it is an ASCII file but it has some header info and the delimiter is not a comma.  You'll need to figure out how to deal with that. \n","\n","The actual data is G(r) and r, that was created from x-ray scattering of an aluminum oxide thin film.  This data is a pair distribution function (PDF) representation of atoms.  Each peak in the G(r) represents a \"pair distance\" between two atoms.  Therefore, the first \"peak\" you see (after about 1.5 Angstrom) represents the closest pairs in the solid (in this case Al-O pairs).  \n","\n","1.   Using the file \"ALDalumina.gr\" in the /Homework/HW1 folder on github, load this file into a dataframe.  It is an ASCII file, but there may be header information that you may ignore.  \n","2.   Plot the first column (r in Angstrom) on the x axis and the second column (G(r)) on the y axis on a linear plot.  Label axes!\n","3.   Calculate and plot the derivitive (dG/dr) on a second plot, as a function of r.  (there is a numpy function for this that you were not shown in class)\n","4.   Using python commands in your program, save a .png and a .svg image file of your plots.  \n","\n"]}]}

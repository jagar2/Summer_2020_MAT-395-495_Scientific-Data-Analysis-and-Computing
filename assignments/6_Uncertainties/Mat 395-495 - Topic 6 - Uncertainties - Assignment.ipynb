(A scintillator material absorbs high energy particles emitted, e.g. during nuclear fission, and emits a light pulse as a response.) You task two students to count the number of light pulses the scintillator emits. Student A watches your material for 3 minutes and counts 28 pulses. Student B watches it for 30 minutes and counts 310 pulses. \n","\n","1. What should Student A report for the average number emitted pulses in 3 minutes with the appropriate uncertainty?\n","1.

# Summer_2020_MAT-395-495_Scientific-Data-Analysis-and-Computing
Introduces basic methods and code development tools for scientific computing in the Python language, including coding, analysis, data fitting, visualization, importing/exporting information, multidimensional analysis, and visualization using Python and its packages MatPlotlib, NumPy, SciPy. Basic statistical methods, distributions, data fitting and error analysis will be discussed with a focus on relevancy for material scientists and engineers. In addition to numerical approaches, symbolic problem solving will be discussed. Integration of external data sets, databases queries, and collective tools into computational methods are introduced.
